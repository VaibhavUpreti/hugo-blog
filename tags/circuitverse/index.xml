      <description>ðŸŽ¯ GOAL: Customise notification events
With reference to issue #3395 &amp;amp; PR #3396 in Circuitverse
There were two methods to make this work -

I found the second approach better and implemented the same. It was most used by rails developers to implement such features.</description>
