CircuitVerse was a partner project in [FOSS Hack 2023](https://archive.fossunited.org/fosshack/2023/partner-projects-list/CircuitVerse), an initiative by FOSS United to promote Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in India. FOSS United is dedicated to fostering a strong open-source ecosystem by supporting developers, projects, and events that drive innovation and collaboration.

As a mentor, I had the opportunity to guide students working on CircuitVerse, helping them contribute to an open-source platform used by over 500 universities worldwide.
