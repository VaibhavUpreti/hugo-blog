CircuitVerse is a widely adopted open-source platform for digital logic design, serving **200,000+ users worldwide**. It is utilized by **500+ universities** as a key tool for teaching logic design.

For the past **seven years**, CircuitVerse has been an active participant in **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**, enabling students to contribute to open-source while gaining hands-on experience in software development.

I currently serve as a **Core Team Member** at [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/about), contributing to its growth, mentorship programs, and community-driven development.
