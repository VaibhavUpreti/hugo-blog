## ðŸŽ¯ GOAL
Adding Notification Events to Simple Discussion 

Adding two new notification events:

1. Notifying Admins on a new thread post 
2. Notifications to users that have subscribed to the thread



## New Thread notification:
This sends notification to all moderators about a new thread, so that they can respond to the query asap.

For example in the following 


-  for all admin users, moderators so that they can resolve the query asap.
- eg: ref, both the admin user receive notification when `user1` posted a new thread.
