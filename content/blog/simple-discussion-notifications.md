## ðŸŽ¯ GOAL
Adding Notification Events to Simple Discussion 

Adding two new notification events:

1. Admin users(moderators) receive notification of all new threads.
2. All users that are subscribed to thread receive a comment notification. 


## Forum Thread Notifications

This sends notification to all moderators about a new thread, so that they can respond to the query asap.

For example in the following

There were two methods to make this work -

1. To make a preferences table with users as foreign key and notification events as attributes.
2. To user rails ActiveRecord::Store and add a preferences hash/jsonb to users to table.

I found the second approach better and implemented the same. It was most used by rails developers to implement such features.

## ðŸ‘¤ Implementing the preferences in users model
Setting default notification settings to be true for each user.(which they can edit later)

```ruby
store :preferences, accessors: %i[star fork], coder: JSON
after_commit :set_preferences, on: :create

def set_preferences
    preferences[:star] = "true"
    preferences[:fork] = "true"
end
```
