# Week 12 (21 August - 27 August)


As the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program comes to an end, we have to submit our final evaluation, which includes a webpage link documenting all the 
work done during the period.
This link is displayed on our GSoC project profile page and can be used as proof of work when presenting to future recruiters.

As the program concludes, I find myself feeling nostalgic about the entire experience. I'll genuinely miss the journey.
For a more detailed account of my GSoC adventure, you can check out my blog post at:

Learnt a lot about open source, how to work in teams.
Throughout this journey, I've learned a great deal about open source collaboration and working effectively in teams. 
Looking ahead, I aspire to become a better software developer.

As I wrap up my GSoC journey, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with mentors like Aboobacker.
The skills and experiences gained during this period will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors in the world of software development. 
Here's to the end of a successful GSoC, and I look forward to applying the knowledge gained in future projects!
