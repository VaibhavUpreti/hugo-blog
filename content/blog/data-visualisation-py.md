## Importance
Data preprocessing is a step in the data mining and data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format that can be understood and analyzed by computers and machine learning.

Data preprocessing is a data mining technique which is used to transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format.

**Steps in data preprocessing**

**1. Data Cleaning:**¬†
The data can have many irrelevant and missing parts. To handle this part, data cleaning is done. It involves handling of missing data, noisy data etc.¬†

- **(a). Missing Data:**¬†
This situation arises when some data is missing in the data. It can be handled in various ways.¬†
