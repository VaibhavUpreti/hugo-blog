- The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd
  Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee
  that was constituted by the government earlier that year.

- The idea of Fundamental Duties is inspired by the **Constitution of Russia (erstwhile Soviet Union).**

## Implementation of Fundamental Duties

### **the Need to Legally Enforce Fundamental Duties**

- Since time immemorial the emphasis in **Indian society in accordance with the dictates of the ancient scriptures** has been on the individual‚Äôs **‚ÄòKartavya‚Äù.**
    - This is the performance of one‚Äôs duties towards society, the country and especially towards one‚Äôs parents.
    
- In the **erstwhile Soviet Union Constitution,** the rights and duties were placed on the same footing.
    - There is a pressing need to **enforce and implement at least some of the fundamental duties.**

- The Supreme Court‚Äôs ***Ranganath Mishra judgment 2003*** held that fundamental duties should not only be enforced by **legal sanctions but also by social sanctions.**
