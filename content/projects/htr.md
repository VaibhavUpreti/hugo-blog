Under the mentorship of [Dr. Neeraj Garg](https://cse.mait.ac.in/index.php/academics/faculty-and-staff/head-and-faculties), Head of AI & ML, conducted extensive research on a range of Deep Learning techniques applied to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. This research centered around key areas such as image classification, segmentation, generative adversarial networks (GANs), convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), and included foundational work with transformer models.
