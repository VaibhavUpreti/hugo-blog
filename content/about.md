Hi, I’m Vaibhav! I’m an open-source software enthusiast who enjoys writing code, shipping features, and working with teams to build great software.

Below are my “formal” work experiences. I also contribute to open-source software, and consider that as an “experience” too (see [/open-source](../open-source/)). I have also mentored several students who are new at writing code. Check out my cool projects at (see [/projects](../projects))
